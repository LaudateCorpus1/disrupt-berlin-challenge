-   Location History API to store the location of drivers and retrace their steps using the Routing API
-   Matrix Routing API to calculate travel times between multiple origins & destinations so you can dispatch the right driver
-   Search API to search for destinations or convert GPS positions to addresses
-   Maps SDK for Web and/or Mobile to display the location of your drivers and assets on a map

**Submissions will be judged based on:**
-   Extent of the use of the different features offered by TomTom
-   Features offered by the service: tracking, notifications, directions, etc.
-   Innovative approach to on demand services challenges
