## Challange requirements
**Build the next Uber for…**
Delivering food, parcels or groceries. Getting a ride or getting someone to come and fix your bike. Location technology can add so much to the services we use everyday.
Your challenge, should you accept it, is to use the TomTom Maps APIs (and combine it with other services) to build an innovative on-demand service.

**Some TomTom Maps APIs features that could prove useful:**
-   Geofencing API to understand when a driver is on site or approaching
-   Location History API to store the location of drivers and retrace their steps using the Routing API
-   Matrix Routing API to calculate travel times between multiple origins & destinations so you can dispatch the right driver
-   Search API to search for destinations or convert GPS positions to addresses
-   Maps SDK for Web and/or Mobile to display the location of your drivers and assets on a map

**Submissions will be judged based on:**
-   Extent of the use of the different features offered by TomTom
-   Features offered by the service: tracking, notifications, directions, etc.
-   Innovative approach to on demand services challenges
-   Overall design and UX”
-   Progress made during the hackathon
